## What's New

Cornerstone now includes a full timeline and scheduling system. Visualize your entire construction project on an interactive Gantt chart, manage milestones to track major progress points, and let the scheduling engine automatically calculate optimal dates based on task dependencies.

### Highlights

- **Interactive Gantt Chart** -- SVG-based timeline visualization with horizontal bars for work items, dependency arrows between connected tasks, critical path highlighting, a today marker, and three zoom levels (day, week, month) with adjustable column widths
- **Calendar View** -- Monthly and weekly calendar grids showing work items as multi-day colored bars and milestones as diamond markers, with navigation controls and view persistence
- **Milestones** -- Create named checkpoints with target dates, link contributing and dependent work items, and see projected completion dates with automatic late detection when a milestone is at risk of slipping
- **Scheduling Engine** -- Critical Path Method (CPM) based automatic scheduling that respects all four dependency types (FS, SS, FF, SF), lead/lag days, and start-after/start-before constraints
- **Auto-Reschedule** -- Server-side automatic rescheduling of not-started work items when a new day begins, keeping your schedule current without manual intervention
- **Responsive & Accessible** -- Full keyboard navigation, ARIA roles on all SVG elements, touch-friendly two-tap interaction on mobile, and proper dark mode support across all timeline components
