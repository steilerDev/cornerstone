# Admin Panel

The admin panel lets administrators manage user accounts. Access it from the sidebar under **Admin > Users**.

## User List

The admin panel shows all registered users with:

- Display name
- Email address
- Role (Admin or Member)
- Account status (active or deactivated)
- Search and filtering

## Managing Users

### Edit Roles

Change a user's role between Admin and Member. Role changes take effect immediately.

### Deactivate Accounts

Deactivate a user account to prevent them from logging in without deleting their data. Deactivated users:

- Cannot log in (local or OIDC)
- Remain visible in user lists and assignment dropdowns
- Can be reactivated at any time

:::caution
You cannot deactivate your own account or the last remaining admin account.
