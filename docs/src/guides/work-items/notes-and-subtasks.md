# Notes & Subtasks

## Notes

Add notes to any work item to track progress, record decisions, or leave information for other users.

### Features

- **Author attribution** -- each note shows who wrote it and when
- **Edit and delete** -- note authors and admins can modify or remove notes
- **Chronological display** -- notes appear in order with timestamps

### Adding a Note

On the work item detail page, type your note in the text area at the bottom and click **Add Note**.

## Subtasks

Break down work items into smaller subtasks with a checklist interface.

### Features

- **Toggle completion** -- mark subtasks complete or incomplete with a single click
- **Reorder** -- rearrange subtasks using up/down buttons
- **Add and remove** -- create new subtasks or delete existing ones

### Adding Subtasks

On the work item detail page, use the subtask section to add checklist items. Each subtask has a title and a completion checkbox.

:::tip
Subtasks are great for breaking down complex tasks. For example, "Install kitchen" might have subtasks like "Order cabinets", "Schedule installer", "Verify measurements", and "Final inspection".
