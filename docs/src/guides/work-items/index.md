# Work Items

Work items are the core of Cornerstone. Each work item represents a task in your construction project -- from "Install kitchen cabinets" to "Schedule electrical inspection."

## Overview

Work items support:

- **Statuses** -- Not Started, In Progress, Completed, or Blocked
- **Dates and scheduling** -- Start dates, end dates, durations, and scheduling constraints
- **User assignment** -- Assign tasks to any user on your instance
- **Tags** -- Color-coded labels for categorization (e.g., "Electrical", "Plumbing")
- **Notes** -- Timestamped comments with author attribution
- **Subtasks** -- Checklist items within a work item
- **Dependencies** -- Relationships between work items (what must happen before or after)

## List View

The work items list page provides:

- **Search** -- Full-text search with debounced input for fast results
- **Filtering** -- Filter by status, assigned user, or tag
- **Sorting** -- Sort by title, status, start date, end date, created date, or updated date
- **Pagination** -- Paginated results for large projects
- **Responsive layout** -- Table view on desktop, card view on mobile and tablet

All filter and sort settings are synced to the URL, so your view is bookmarkable and shareable.
