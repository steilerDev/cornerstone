# Subsidies

Subsidy programs reduce the effective cost of your construction project. Cornerstone supports both percentage-based and fixed-amount subsidies, each scoped to a specific budget category.

## Subsidy Types

| Type | How It Works | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Percentage** | Reduces costs in the linked category by a percentage | 15% energy efficiency rebate on HVAC costs |
| **Fixed Amount** | Reduces costs in the linked category by a flat amount | $2,000 insulation grant |

## Creating a Subsidy

Navigate to **Budget > Subsidies** in the sidebar. Click **New Subsidy** and provide:

- **Name** -- A descriptive label (e.g., "Energy Efficiency Rebate")
- **Type** -- Percentage or Fixed Amount
- **Amount / Rate** -- The fixed amount or percentage rate
- **Budget Category** -- Which category this subsidy applies to
- **Status** -- The current status of the subsidy application

## Subsidy Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Application submitted, awaiting decision |
| **Approved** | Subsidy approved but not yet received |
| **Rejected** | Subsidy application was denied |
| **Disbursed** | Subsidy funds have been received |

Only subsidies with **Approved** or **Disbursed** status are applied to budget calculations. Pending and rejected subsidies are tracked but do not affect the budget overview.

## How Subsidies Affect the Budget

Subsidies reduce the total cost shown in the [Budget Overview](budget-overview). A subsidy applies to all budget lines in its linked category across all work items:

- **Percentage subsidy**: Reduces the category total by the specified percentage
- **Fixed-amount subsidy**: Subtracts the flat amount from the category total

Multiple subsidies can apply to the same category, and their reductions stack.
