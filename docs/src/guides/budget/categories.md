# Budget Categories

Budget categories organize your construction costs into logical groups. Every budget line on a work item must belong to a category, making it easy to see how much you're spending on each part of your project.

## Common Categories

Typical categories for a home building project might include:

- Electrical
- Plumbing
- Windows & Doors
- Flooring
- Roofing
- HVAC
- Landscaping
- Permits & Fees

You can create whatever categories make sense for your project.

## Creating a Category

Navigate to **Budget > Categories** in the sidebar. Click **New Category** and provide:

- **Name** -- A short label (e.g., "Electrical")
- **Description** -- Optional details about what costs belong in this category

## Managing Categories

From the categories page you can:

- **Edit** a category's name or description
- **Delete** a category that is no longer needed

:::caution
Deleting a category will fail if any budget lines are still assigned to it. Reassign or remove those budget lines first.
