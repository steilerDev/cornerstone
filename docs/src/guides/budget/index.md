# Budget

The budget system in Cornerstone helps you track construction costs across your entire project. Organize expenses by category, manage multiple financing sources, track vendor invoices, and apply subsidies -- all with real-time projections that account for estimate confidence levels.

## Overview

The budget system provides:

- **Budget Categories** -- Organize costs into categories like "Electrical", "Plumbing", or "Windows & Doors"
- **Financing Sources** -- Track where money comes from (construction loan, savings, family loan) with depletion tracking
- **Work Item Budget Lines** -- Link estimated costs to work items with confidence levels that reflect estimate accuracy
- **Vendors & Invoices** -- Track vendors, their invoices, and line items linked to budget lines
- **Subsidy Programs** -- Manage percentage-based or fixed-amount subsidies that reduce your effective costs
- **Budget Overview Dashboard** -- See your project's financial health at a glance with four "remaining budget" perspectives

## How It Fits Together

Each **work item** can have one or more **budget lines**. A budget line connects a work item to a **budget category** and a **financing source** with an estimated amount and confidence level.

When a vendor submits an **invoice**, you link invoice line items to the relevant budget lines. This replaces the estimate with the actual cost and automatically updates the budget overview.

**Subsidies** reduce the total amount needed from financing sources, applied per budget category.
