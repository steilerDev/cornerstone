# Budget

:::caution Under Development
The budget management feature is currently under development. The backend implementation is complete, and the frontend is being built. This page will be updated as the feature becomes available.
:::

Budget management in Cornerstone will provide:

- **Category-based budgeting** -- organize costs by budget categories
- **Multiple financing sources** -- track budgets across different financing sources (e.g., construction loan, savings, family loan)
- **Work item cost tracking** -- link budget lines to work items with confidence levels
- **Vendor invoices** -- track invoice status (pending, paid, claimed)
- **Subsidy tracking** -- manage subsidies with percentage-based or fixed-amount reductions

See the [Roadmap](/roadmap) for the latest status of this feature.
