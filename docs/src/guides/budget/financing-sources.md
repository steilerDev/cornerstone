# Financing Sources

Financing sources represent where the money for your construction project comes from. Each source has a total amount, and Cornerstone tracks how much of each source has been depleted based on actual invoice costs.

## Examples

- **Construction Loan** -- $250,000
- **Savings** -- $50,000
- **Family Loan** -- $20,000

## Creating a Financing Source

Navigate to **Budget > Financing Sources** in the sidebar. Click **New Source** and provide:

- **Name** -- A descriptive label (e.g., "Construction Loan")
- **Total Amount** -- The total amount available from this source

## Depletion Tracking

Each financing source displays how much has been spent. Depletion is calculated from the actual cost of invoices linked to budget lines that use this source:

- **Invoiced amounts** are summed to show how much of the source has been used
- A progress bar shows the percentage depleted
- The remaining balance updates automatically as invoices are added

This gives you a clear picture of how much funding remains in each source.

## Managing Sources

From the financing sources page you can:

- **Edit** a source's name or total amount
- **Delete** a source that is no longer needed

:::caution
Deleting a financing source will fail if any budget lines reference it. Reassign or remove those budget lines first.
