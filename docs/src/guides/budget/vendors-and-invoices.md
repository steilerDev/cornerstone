# Vendors & Invoices

Vendors are the companies and contractors that provide services or materials for your project. Each vendor can have multiple invoices, and each invoice can have line items linked to budget lines on your work items.

## Vendors

### Vendor List

Navigate to **Budget > Vendors** in the sidebar to see all vendors. The list supports:

- **Search** -- Find vendors by name
- **Sorting** -- Sort by name or creation date
- **Pagination** -- Browse through large vendor lists

### Creating a Vendor

Click **New Vendor** and provide the vendor's name.

### Vendor Detail

Click a vendor to see their detail page, which shows the vendor's information and all their invoices.

## Invoices

### Invoice List

Navigate to **Budget > Invoices** in the sidebar to see all invoices across all vendors. The list supports:

- **Search** -- Find invoices by number or vendor name
- **Status Filter** -- Filter by Pending, Paid, or Claimed
- **Sorting** -- Sort by date, amount, or status
- **Pagination** -- Browse through large invoice lists

### Creating an Invoice

From a vendor's detail page, click **New Invoice** and provide:

- **Invoice Number** -- The vendor's invoice reference number
- **Date** -- The invoice date
- **Line Items** -- One or more line items, each with a description, amount, and optional link to a budget line

### Invoice Statuses

Invoices progress through three statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Invoice received but not yet paid |
| **Paid** | Invoice has been paid to the vendor |
| **Claimed** | Payment has been claimed from / reimbursed by the financing source |

### Invoice Line Items

Each invoice contains one or more line items. A line item can be linked to a **budget line** on a work item. When linked, the invoice amount replaces the budget line's estimate and the confidence level is set to "Invoice" automatically.

This is how estimates transition to actual costs -- as invoices arrive, your budget projections become more accurate.
