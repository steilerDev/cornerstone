# Cornerstone

A self-hosted home building project management tool for homeowners. Track work items, budgets, timelines, and household item purchases from a single Docker container backed by SQLite -- no external database required.

## Who is Cornerstone for?

Cornerstone is designed for **homeowners managing a construction or renovation project**. Whether you're building a new home, renovating a floor, or coordinating multiple contractors, Cornerstone gives you a single place to track everything.

- **1-5 users per instance** -- built for a household, not an enterprise
- **Self-hosted** -- your data stays on your hardware
- **Single Docker container** -- no external database, no complex infrastructure

## Key Features

- **Work Items** -- Create and manage construction tasks with statuses, dates, assignments, tags, notes, subtasks, and dependencies
- **Budget Management** -- Track costs with budget categories, financing sources, vendor invoices, subsidies, and a dashboard with multiple projection perspectives
- **Authentication** -- Local accounts with first-run setup wizard, plus OIDC single sign-on for existing identity providers
- **User Management** -- Admin and Member roles with a dedicated admin panel
- **Dark Mode** -- Light, Dark, or System theme with instant switching
- **Design System** -- Consistent visual language with CSS custom property tokens

See the [Roadmap](roadmap) for upcoming features like Gantt charts and household item tracking.
